# Vehicle-trajectory-prediction
Vehicle trajectory prediction involves using deep sort and YOLO for object detection to track a car's coordinates in video. These coordinates, along with speed data, are stored in a database. This dataset is then used to train a model, often using LSTM, to predict future vehicle coordinates based on historical data.
