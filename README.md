# Vehicle-trajectory-prediction
Vehicle trajectory prediction involves using deep sort and YOLO for object detection to track a car's coordinates in video. These coordinates, along with speed data, are stored in a database. This dataset is then used to train a model, often using LSTM, to predict future vehicle coordinates based on historical data. 

**The code to find coordinates is available in a zip file with the name predict.py along with the video.**
**Code to transform the dataset** : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XUchBZ2VPWT8da4lHNpywIIl5fYUh9tG#scrollTo=lICOW-LxnG0v
**NOTE :  test_excel.xlsx is transform to xy_test.xlsc using above code both are present in zip file attached below.**
